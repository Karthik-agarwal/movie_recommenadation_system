# movie_recommenadation_system

I have used the basics of recommendation systems into developing one of the entertaining and thrilling Machine Laearning projects.
The main components of this are the :
1. Similarity Calculation
2. Recommendation Logic

   1. SIMILARIY CALCULATION:
   The similarity matrix, which is used to find similar movies, is typically computed using machine learning techniques.
   This matrix might be based on cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or other methods that measure how similar two items are based on their features .

   2. RECOMMENDATION LOGIC:
   The recommend function uses this similarity matrix to recommend movies that are similar to a given movie. This is a fundamental part of collaborative filtering, which is a 
   common machine learning approach in recommendation systems.

Explanation:

1. Data Preparation: You load movie data and a precomputed similarity matrix. These are usually derived from machine learning models trained on historical data about movies and user interactions.

2. Model Application: The recommend function applies the model (in this case, the similarity matrix) to generate recommendations.

From this project we have learnt the following :
1. How to handle and preprocess data.
2. Basics of recommendation systems.
3. Application of similarity measures.
4. Integration of a machine learning model with a web interface using Streamlit.
